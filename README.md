# time_series_singlegate_object_location
For study time series with channel window gate for location movement, forward - backward time series. Windowed channel or input mapping can perform strengthening or resizing of data by remaining significants as you see in the signalings, and communication but it also working for gate location in the picture too. Compare time series location change and bitmap height width networks object location.

## Window series function ##

Input wavelengths from wave file or microphones, video or time series input can shorten lengths or strengthen or resize data for various purposes, engineer working from the same views as us they had the same inputs with only image or wave file represent data [ 0. ] to [ 255. ] or sample data 67.7777777779 but they need to build a system that can tell you when someone passing the door gate or movement to create a robots or machine for services or maintain services.

From the codes it look simply, only compare of current time and forward input but for actual system you can apply ore algorithms for advance imeplementation or integrations. How does the information cannot extracting from signals ðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸ”º or phases replacement that is why water masks had effects on picture information not only smiles logo they never talking about.

```
def windowed_dataset(series, time_step):
    dataX, dataY = [], []
    for i in range( math.ceil( len(series) / time_step ) ):
        source = ( time_step * i )
        dest = time_step * ( i + 1 )
        a = series[source : dest, 0]
        dataX.append(a)
        dataY.append(series[source : dest, 0])
	
    return np.array(dataX), np.array(dataY)
```
